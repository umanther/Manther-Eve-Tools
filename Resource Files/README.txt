Thanks for installing Manther Eve Tools

These tools are the result of weeks of research and testing.
I made these tools in an attempt to make some of the more
confusing aspects of Eve a little easier to use, so that
people could make informed decisions.

I still have alot planned for MET, so as I learn more about
how to add features, expect updates.
I'm also always open to comments and suggestions.

This program is freeware and can be openly distributed.
